      "summary": "By decoupling how agents work from how they’re trained, Agent Lightning turns each step an agent takes into data for reinforcement learning. This makes it easy for developers to improve agent performance with almost zero code changes.\nThe post Agent Lightning: Adding reinforcement learning to AI agents without code rewrites appeared first on Microsoft Research.",
